# Eye Care Reminder
Simple Windows app to follow the 20-20-20 rule for eyes

## How it works
It shows a notification on screen, that once acknowledged will instruct you to look away from the screen for a certain period of time. After that time it will ring a bell to let you know that you can look back.

Default values are 20 minutes for screen time and 20 seconds for rest time.


## Configuration
Values for time and sound can be configured in config.json.

## Installation
It is recommended to run it at startup by adding it to you Startup folder (you can do Win+r and execute shell:startup to open that folder).
